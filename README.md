**Explanation:**

* **JavaScript/, HTML-CSS/:** These folders contain projects and assignments specifically related to these web development technologies.
* **Year Folders (e.g., 2023/, 2024/):** Inside each subject folder, the work is further organized by the year it was completed.
* **Month Folders (e.g., 08-August/, 11-November/):** Within each year folder, you'll find folders named with the month of completion (using the `MM-MonthName` format for clarity).

This structure allows for easy navigation and helps in locating specific assignments based on the subject and the time they were completed.
